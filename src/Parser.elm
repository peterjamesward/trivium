{-
   Starting over as our output is domain model not triples.
   Our grammar is still simple and allows TTL-like statements.

   document = sentence { . sentenceList } EOF
   sentence = subject phraseList .
   subject = node | link
   link = node -> node
   phraseList = relation objectList [ ; phraseList ]
   objectList = object [ , objectList ]

   Lexer handles character level stuff so we get a list of tokens.
   There are reserved words with important semantics.
   All statements (phrases) in a sentence apply to the subject of that sentence only.
   There can be multiple statements about a node subject.
   But each sentence with a link subject is distinct - the link has a unique internal identity.

   Module (object) - signifies that a document contains architecture content.
   Diagram (object) - signifies that a document contains layout and styles.
   'is' or 'a' (relation) - subject in an instance of type object.
   Type - subject designates an architecture domain type.
   Link - subject designates an architecture domain link type and can be used as a relation.
   -> - there is a relation between subject and object and will be defined via the phraseList.
   Style (object) - the subject is used to convey style information, in a Diagram usually.
   colour (red, orange, ..)
   shape  (cube, sphere, cylinder, cone, ..)
   direction (N,S,E,W,U,D)
   label (relation)
   style (binding) - <style> apply <link type>. or <link type> apply <style>. ?

{-
   Parser options. Recursive descent or state machine. Latter more flexible.
   Am I building the Module state here, or something preliminary?
   That is, I probably need to do spmoe more semantics using reserved words,
   looking at types and stuff.
   Previously I returned Triples and that actually was not a bad idea, as they're fairly
   easy to scan for types etc. Avoids ordering dependencies, allows for implied types.
   Difference here is uniqueness of each link sentence.

   We essentially fold the parse state over the token list.
   May be easier to have a long-hand fold, to make pattern matching explicit.
   Need parse state with partial parse, and collect the output (triples).
