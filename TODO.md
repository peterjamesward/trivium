- Maybe add random force (diminishing).
- Highlight yellow in list when waiting for a module to download.

- Tidy the UI.
- Make SVG labels clearer with background and border (or similar).
- Make multiple tabs in main window (input | output).

- Report lex and parse errors with line and column.
- Highlight loaded modules that are outdated.
- Auto-stop animation after some seconds, or if no motion can be detected would be nice.
