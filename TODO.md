BUG? Is Save no updating backend?
- Work out how make the Inspector pane act like hyperlinks.
- E.g.: click on Protocol = http and it applies a filter, highlights matches, or loads "http" module...

- Optimise repulsive forces with octree.
- Use 3 dimensions for raw triples graph. (On what basis, I know not.)
- Highlight yellow in module list when waiting for a module to download.

- Tidy the UI. 
- Collapse edit pane if not editing.

- Report lex and parse errors with line and column.
- Highlight loaded modules that are outdated.
- Auto-stop animation if no motion detected would be nice.
- Optimisation - send diffs between back and front ends.

- Add Clockwise and Anticlockwise link alignment fields.
- Spatial index for click detection (optimisation).
