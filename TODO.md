# WIP

- Add Inspector pane.
- Mouse over to show all attributes in SVG for nodes and links?
- (May need to optimise content for "nearest" detection.)
- Optimise repulsive forces with octree.

- Use 3 dimensions for raw triples graph. (On what basis, I know not.)
- Maybe add random force (diminishing).
- Highlight yellow in module list when waiting for a module to download.

- Tidy the UI. 
- Collapse edit pane if not editing.
- Make SVG labels clearer with background and border (or similar).

- Report lex and parse errors with line and column.
- Highlight loaded modules that are outdated.
- Auto-stop animation after some seconds, or if no motion can be detected would be nice.
- Optimisation - send diffs between back and front ends.

- Save to file.
- File load.

- Add Clockwise and Anticlockwise link alignment fields.
