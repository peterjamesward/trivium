# WIP

- Styling - binding a Style to a type (but no additional syntax required).
- Option to curve link (maybe a spline).

- Ability to add Layout instead of Module.
- Allow selection of one Layout for editing.
- Add Inspector pane.
- Optimise repulsive forces with octree.

- When adding content, preserve current positions?
- Maybe add random force (diminishing).
- Highlight yellow when waiting for a module to download.

- Tidy the UI.
- Make labels clearer with background and border (or similar).
- Make multiple tabs in main window (input | output).

- Report lex and parse errors with line and column.
- Highlight loaded modules that are outdated.
- Auto-stop animation after some seconds, or if no motion can be detected would be nice.
- Optimisation - send diffs between back and front ends.

- Save to file.
- File load.

- Add Clockwise and Anticlockwise link alignment fields.
